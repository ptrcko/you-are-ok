  <h2>Thought Record</h2>
  <p>This tool gathers the context around a distressing thought so you can revisit it later.</p>
  <p class="notice">Purpose: capture situations, automatic thoughts, feelings, and optional follow-up ideas without judgement.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How to use it</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Note the situation: what was happening, who was there, and when it occurred.</li>
    <li>Write the automatic thought in your own words. Keep it brief and honest.</li>
    <li>List the feelings that came up and rate their intensity if that helps you.</li>
    <li>Identify any evidence that supports the thought.</li>
    <li>Add evidence that does not support the thought or offers alternative perspectives.</li>
    <li>End with a balanced response or next-step idea, even if it is a simple reassurance.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Suggested structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Situation</strong>: a short description plus time/date.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic thought</strong>: the exact wording that ran through your mind.</li>
    <li><strong>Feelings</strong>: emotions and physical sensations you noticed.</li>
    <li><strong>Supporting evidence</strong>: observations that seem to back up the thought.</li>
    <li><strong>Contradicting evidence</strong>: details that weaken the thought or point elsewhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Balanced response</strong>: a kinder or more nuanced statement to carry forward.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>What it is not for</h2>
