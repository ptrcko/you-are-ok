  <h2>A quiet reference library</h2>
  <p>You Are OK is an open, neutral catalogue of CBT and TEAM-CBT tools. It is designed to be calm, privacy-first, and free of nudges toward any single path.</p>
  <p class="notice">Everything here is static and local. There is no account system, no storage, and no data capture in this step.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Explore the tools</h2>
  <p>Browse the available tools at your own pace. Each entry includes a concise purpose statement and a placeholder page describing what it is (and what it is not).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{ '/tools/' | relative_url }}">View the tools index</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this layer exists</h2>
  <p>This navigation layer completes Step 1 of the project plan: discovery without implementation. It helps you see what is available before any data handling or exercise logic exists.</p>
  <p class="status-note">Future steps will add optional, user-controlled data entry. Those pieces are intentionally absent here to keep this stage focused on structure and clarity.</p>
